# 👋 Hey, I'm Ashvin

Junior IT professional trying to survive the cloud, build things that don’t crash, and occasionally deploy entire systems on way-too-small VPS machines. Started coding back in 11th grade with Python toys like calculators and odd/even games, and… well, here we are.

These days I'm deep into cloud, infrastructure, mobile apps, backend APIs, and running full-stack projects end to end. Also a freelance developer, part-time tech fixer, and full-time tinkerer.
