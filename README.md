# About Me! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3rd year BCA student passionate about coding and technology. I got into computer science during 11th grade when I started working with Python and building projects like calculators and quirky odd or even games, which sparked a deep interest in coding and motivated me to pursue BCA and enter the IT sector.Now, I'm eagerly preparing to make my mark in this ever-evolving field!
